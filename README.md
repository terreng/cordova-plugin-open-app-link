# cordova-plugin-open-app-link

**Android and iOS**

A Cordova plugin for opening a link only if there's an app installed to handle it. If there's no app that opens the link, it will fail. This is intended for use with cordova-plugin-safariviewcontroller, which has the unforunate side-effect of not respecting app deep links.

## Install
`cordova plugin add cordova-plugin-open-app-link`

## Usage
```js
//TODO
